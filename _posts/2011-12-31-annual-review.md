##Statistic Summary

I have recorded my time usage in 43 weeks this year and in total I have recorded 2175 hours in which 2403 pomodros are used on tasks. In average everyday I use 6.84 hours and 8.36 pomodoros.

##Overall Performance

  2011 is an crucial year for me. I strayed away from my Economics background and started carving out my way to become "a person who creates something useful". I chose the web as the first field to explore.

  I planned one year to develop enough skills to start working but the result turned out much better than my expectation. In April, I built the website and contributed to the design work of the TEDxFiveStarSquare which is pulled off by a great team. Later I joined in an energetic start-up and created their order-processing web-application for restaurants and contributed to the new website redesign and later re-factored its architecture in a modularized way.

  I have developed enough skills and knowledge for frontend design/development and some fundamental skills for system administration. (Read more on [Technology Development Reviews])

  The progress is mostly due to the [personal management system] I developed to manage my times and goals. It helps me to persist and focus on the most important stuff day in day out.

  However, on the other aspects of my life, things doesn't work out as expected. Mostly due to my work, English learning had been paused in the second half year, travel plan to Southern Asia was canceled. And I am still suffering from anxieties and depression from time to time and getting up early still eludes me. The worst might be the backbone aches I began to experience late of the year.

  From the ups and downs of 2011, I also learned a lot [Lessons] and ready to [Move Forward].

##Highlights
  March 14th, I made a [[presentation]] talking about what hinders adult learning at Barcamp Shanghai. This is also the place where I met Peter and later the whole TEDxFSS team

  May 15th, I designed and deployed [[the site for TEDxFiveStarSquare]] and later designed the banner/poster/screen for the event. This is my first attempt for design and development.

  June 7th, I started the Napos project with [ELEME](http://ele.me) and later on August 24th, I joined the team in charge of UI design and frontend development. This is the most effective team I met ever before - energetic, down-to-earth and hard work. I gained valuable project experience with the development.

  August 21th, I did a [[presentation]] about making a change in your life at TEDxYouth West-lake.

  November 26th, I decided to leave ELEME as I have a quite different methodology to make things tick with the team and I found I my health, production output and learning progress all declined after I joined the team.

##Detailed Review

###English Writing
  The biggest achievement for English study is that I developed a memorizing system with [[Supermemo]] methodology for learning. I collected sentences and words from my reading and quoted the detailed explanation in that context from dictionaries. Later this collection will be transformed into Supermemo items (with the format of xml) through a script I wrote myself. Supermemo will take care of the daily drills to make sure I will remember those I come across before.

  Through out the year, this is what I have remembered:

  * Words usage in 2151 sentences;
  * 1412 Nouns;
  * 441 oral phrases;
  * 2477 words spelling.

  The system makes my learning accumulative, the drills are planned out according to the supermemo algorithm which makes sure I will remember what I have learned.

  Although working out well, the performance still far fell short of the goals I set in the beginning of the year as I paused learning new words in the 2nd half year due to my work. The urgency of work is much higher than supermemo drills, and I started to postpone some drills in June and this initial habit breaking leads to a permanent stop. At the end of the year, I had more than 3000 drills need to be catch up with.

  Under the same reason, I also missed the goals for English reading and writing.

  I plan to write 15 publishable articles (20,000 words) this year but I ended up in only [[the one]] I wrote for Barcamp. I plan to read through 10 non-tech English books but I didn't archive it. There are around ten books I have touched this year but I didn't finish all of them.

  * Hermann Hesse - <Siddhartha> listened several times with audio version.
  * Rilke - <Letters To A Young Poet> read through
  * Ernest Hemingway - <The Old Man and the Sea> read through several times and recited the first 20% of the book.
  * Carson McCullers - <The Heart is a Lonely Hunter> Finished Part one
  * Malcolm Gladwell - <Outliers -The Story Of Success>, listened the audiobook.
  * Malcolm Gladwell - <Blink>, listened with the audiobook.
  * Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi - <Flow>, read through once
  * !Somebody! - <Bird by Bird>, read 50% of all chapters

  The biggest achievement is that I got myself accustomized to reading electronic books. I built myself an search-able electronic library and I also customize the [[PDFPreview]] with an highlight system to help me correct previous "scanning-as-reading" habit. Green highlights unknown words and phrases, yellow highlights key sentences, red underline marks important material and purple marks where I need to read over again. With the notes and comments, I could archive the same reading experience as reading a paper book.

###Web Design and Computer Science
  I wanted myself to be a "qualified web designer" in the beginning of the year and thanks to my full-time work in the second half year I have exceeded this goal by all means.

  I have acquired all the core skills I planned to master - HTML, CSS, javaScript(jQuery) and designed and created 5 sites. Besides, I also have become an Unix lover (FreeBSD in specific), learned to setup some servers(HTTP, SSH etc.), learned basic Ruby and also contributed [[a little back to the community]].

  Beyond the details of various technology, I began to form a big picture about the whole "web stack" - from how a browser renders a HTTP response to how a server response a HTTP request with several processes to send back meaning full data. This becomes the guide map for [[what I need to learn later]].

  Through trial and error along the road, I have summarized some lessons from learning technologies. If you are sort of geeky, the [[technique learning summary]] might be interesting to you.

  The part that falls short is the financial income. I began to get incomes in June but I didn't hit my goals for saving. The reason is that I compromised my salary for the promise of options in the future. As I left the team, those promise won't be cashed in. I was also quite inactive in the business side. I didn't make any effort to negotiate my incomes or look for contract projects.


###Travel
  Although I have processed material and booked three tickets to Southern Asia, I canceled the itinerary at last because of work in the second half year.

  I set travel the highest priority in the planning, but along the time, I found becoming a good developer and designer motivates me much more than travel. Near the end of year [[Nancy]] quested me with the question "Why are you travel?". It makes me reflect my motivation under traveling - exploration is just a process not a goal, so what is my ultimate goal of living?

  This stunning question the only 'fruit' I harvested.

###Physical Training and Habit
####Personal Management System
  The corner stone for all my growth is the time management system I invented by combining the methods of [[GTD]], [[pomodoro]] and [[Lyubishchev]]. I use GTD to setup top-down goals of one year and I move toward the goals "pomodoro" by "pomodoro". At last, I recorded and audited my time spending to detect problems and improve. I edited the sheet from Chris's ANOC to be used in annual planning and I invented my own sheet for weekly and daily planning.

  As a result, [More Statistic is needed, ] In average I could collect 9 pomodoros each day.

  I also did some improvement to this system:

  * I add the feature-week and feature-day to ramp up energy for something I feel relectant.
  * I separates the hours of working and learning
  * I began to write down everyday tasks in the beginning of the week
  * I would use several pomodoros in a row to handle big tasks
  * I also record normal time spendings

  The lesson learned with this system is:

  * **Always** start your week with a plan.
    When you postponed the planning, you tend to be widdling away your time and lazy around.
  * Plan loosely, work hardly.
    Don't pack too much into your week, when it exceeds your capacity, you will become anxious and frustrated.
  * Leave flexible time with planning.
    Leave rooms for sporadic events.
  * Always motivate yourself.
    I cut the inspiration pomodoro in the second half year and I received a huge motivation decline there.

####Physical Training and Health
  I didn't a bad job in the field of health and training. In the first half year, I only used 18.8 hours for physical training and even this practice stopped in the second half year. So in average, I only have exercised 3 min per day which is far fewer than the 30 min per day.

  As a result, I began to suffer from aches from shoulder and low backbone. In the end of the year, the pain could even last the whole day and make sitting an discomfortable position.

  Another setback in health is my biological clock. The habit of getting up early still eludes me. I was still quite exciting after midnight and I used to work later than 12:00pm since May. The situation got worse when I went to work where I slept later than 2:00am in average. With the shift in sleeping hours, I also have shifted the time I get up - usually 8 hours after I went to bed.

  This shift in sleeping hours dispairs my sleeping quality and I felt a decline in endurance and time of focus when I am working.
