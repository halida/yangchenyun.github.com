##A Successful Change

  2011 is crucial to me. Straying away from my Economics background, I started learning web design and development from scratch and ended up with a result better than my expectation.

###Highlights

  On March 14th, I made a [presentation][link_to_adult_learning] at Barcamp Shanghai talking about what hinders adult learning and I met Peter and later the whole TEDxFSS team.

  On May 15th, I designed and deployed [[the site of TEDxFiveStarSquare]] and later designed the banner, poster and screen for the event. This solidates my confidence to deliver design and development work.

  On June 7th, I started the [Napos](http://ele.me/napos.php) project in [ELEME](http://ele.me) and later I joined the team and took charge of UI design and frontend development.

  On August 21th, I made a [speech](link_to_tedxyouth) about making a change in your life at TEDxYouth West-lake.

###Excerpt of 2011

  I expected one year preparation before I could deliver qualified projects. But the first website was accomplished after five months of learning. I built [the website of TEDxFiveStarSquare(TEDxFSS)](http://tedxfivestarsquare.com, "Link to TEDxFiveStarSquare Website") and later contributed to the design of the whole event. With the help of a great team, we pull off the only one [TEDx Event][link_to_tedxfss_event] in Shanghai. ![TEDxFiveStarSquare Logo](/images/tedxfss_logo.jpg)

  After that, I joined in a start-up company and created a [webapp](http://ele.me/napos.php, "Link to Eleme Napos") for restaurants and contributed to the [new website](http://ele.me/at/entry/1) redesign and later led the frontend development.

  Thanks to the people I worked with, I also have fallen in love with Unix and learned to setup various backend service. A summay on technology learned will cover this geeky issue.

  The progress is mostly due to the [personal management system][link_to_personal_management_system] I have developed to manage my times and goals. In 2011, I recorded 7.58 hours and worked with focus 4.18 hours everyday.

  However in other aspects, things haven't worked out as expected. Due to my work English learning have been paused in the second half year and travel plan to Southern Asia was canceled. Besides I have been suffering from anxieties from time to time and getting up early still eludes me.

  From the ups and downs of 2011, I learned a lot [Lessons][link_to_lesson] and I am thinking about [move forward][link_to_move_forward].

##A More Close Look at 2011

###English Writing
  The biggest achievement for English study is that I have developed a memorizing system with [Supermemo][link_to_supermemo] methodology for learning. I collected sentences and words from my reading and quoted the detailed explanation in that context from dictionaries. Later this collection was transformed into Supermemo items (with the format of xml) through a script. The [Supermemo software][link_to_supermemo_software] then took care of the repeatation plans.

  Through out the year, I have remembered **2151** sentences, **1412** Nouns, **441** oral phrases and **2477** words spelling.

  The repetition plans are calculated according to the supermemo algorithm which makes sure I will remember what I have learned. The learning effort becomes accumulative.

  Although working out well, the performance still has fallen half short of the goals because I had paused learning new words in the 2nd half year due to my work. A initial habit breaking in June finally led to a permanent stop. In November, I had more than 3000 drills need to be caught up with.

  For the same reason, I also missed the goals for English reading and writing.

  I planned to write 15 publishable articles (20,000 words) but I only ended up in only [one][link_to_adult_learning] and some drafts. I also missed the goal to finish 10 non-tech English books. There are about ten books I have opened this year but I didn't finish all of them.

  * Hermann Hesse - <Siddhartha> listened several times with audio version.
  * Rilke - <Letters To A Young Poet> read through
  * Ernest Hemingway - <The Old Man and the Sea> read through several times and recited the first 20% of the book.
  * Carson McCullers - <The Heart is a Lonely Hunter> Finished Part one
  * Malcolm Gladwell - <Outliers -The Story Of Success>, listened the audiobook.
  * Malcolm Gladwell - <Blink>, listened with the audiobook.
  * Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi - <Flow>, read through once
  * !Somebody! - <Bird by Bird>, read 50% of all chapters

  The biggest achievement is that I got myself accustomized to reading electronic books. I built myself an search-able electronic library and I also customize the [[PDFPreview]] with an highlight system to help me correct previous "scanning-as-reading" habit. Green highlights unknown words and phrases, yellow highlights key sentences, red underline marks important material and purple marks where I need to read over again. With the notes and comments, I could archive the same reading experience as reading a paper book.

###Web Design and Computer Science
  I wanted myself to be a "qualified web designer" in the beginning of the year and thanks to my full-time work in the second half year I have exceeded this goal by all means.

  I have acquired all the core skills I planned to master - HTML, CSS, javaScript(jQuery) and designed and created 5 sites. Besides, I also have become an Unix lover (FreeBSD in specific), learned to setup some servers(HTTP, SSH etc.), learned basic Ruby and also contributed [[a little back to the community]].

  Beyond the details of various technology, I began to form a big picture about the whole "web stack" - from how a browser renders a HTTP response to how a server response a HTTP request with several processes to send back meaning full data. This becomes the guide map for [[what I need to learn later]].

  Through trial and error along the road, I have summarized some lessons from learning technologies. If you are sort of geeky, the [[technique learning summary]] might be interesting to you.

  The part that falls short is the financial income. I began to get incomes in June but I didn't hit my goals for saving. The reason is that I compromised my salary for the promise of options in the future. As I left the team, those promise won't be cashed in. I was also quite inactive in the business side. I didn't make any effort to negotiate my incomes or look for contract projects.


###Travel
  Although I have processed material and booked three tickets to Southern Asia, I canceled the itinerary at last because of work in the second half year.

  I set travel the highest priority in the planning, but along the time, I found becoming a good developer and designer motivates me much more than travel. Near the end of year [[Nancy]] quested me with the question "Why are you travel?". It makes me reflect my motivation under traveling - exploration is just a process not a goal, so what is my ultimate goal of living?

  This stunning question the only 'fruit' I harvested.

###Physical Training and Habit
####Personal Management System
  The corner stone for all my growth is the time management system I invented by combining the methods of [[GTD]], [[pomodoro]] and [[Lyubishchev]]. I use GTD to setup top-down goals of one year and I move toward the goals "pomodoro" by "pomodoro". At last, I recorded and audited my time spending to detect problems and improve. I edited the sheet from Chris's ANOC to be used in annual planning and I invented my own sheet for weekly and daily planning.

  As a result, [More Statistic is needed, ] In average I could collect 9 pomodoros each day.

  I also did some improvement to this system:

  * I add the feature-week and feature-day to ramp up energy for something I feel relectant.
  * I separates the hours of working and learning
  * I began to write down everyday tasks in the beginning of the week
  * I would use several pomodoros in a row to handle big tasks
  * I also record normal time spendings

  The lesson learned with this system is:

  * **Always** start your week with a plan.
    When you postponed the planning, you tend to be widdling away your time and lazy around.
  * Plan loosely, work hardly.
    Don't pack too much into your week, when it exceeds your capacity, you will become anxious and frustrated.
  * Leave flexible time with planning.
    Leave rooms for sporadic events.
  * Always motivate yourself.
    I cut the inspiration pomodoro in the second half year and I received a huge motivation decline there.

####Physical Training and Health
  I didn't a bad job in the field of health and training. In the first half year, I only used 18.8 hours for physical training and even this practice stopped in the second half year. So in average, I only have exercised 3 min per day which is far fewer than the 30 min per day.

  As a result, I began to suffer from aches from shoulder and low backbone. In the end of the year, the pain could even last the whole day and make sitting an discomfortable position.

  Another setback in health is my biological clock. The habit of getting up early still eludes me. I was still quite exciting after midnight and I used to work later than 12:00pm since May. The situation got worse when I went to work where I slept later than 2:00am in average. With the shift in sleeping hours, I also have shifted the time I get up - usually 8 hours after I went to bed.

  This shift in sleeping hours dispairs my sleeping quality and I felt a decline in endurance and time of focus when I am working.
