##Lesson 1: Know How to Sustain Yourself

  Making decision is hard, but stick with it is much harder. when I was struggling with self-doubt and fear, I developed two ways to sustain myself: **feed your motivation** with [Qotto](quote.yangchenyun.com) and **always take actions**.

###The Full Story
  After the first thrilling week after I dived into computer science, things turned out to be much more difficult than I thought before. It's as if without preparation I walked into a Arabic village with a map full of mystical symbols which seems to contain the biggest secret of the city. I started with the simpliest ones, tried to understand it through searching and asking.

  After I have acquired the basic knowledge, I soon realized that there are more areas I need to explore, the map I had is just the entrance of a much bigger world. From times to times, I received news about this bigger world. The more news I heart about it, the eager I wanted to see it, the more frustrating I became - because it is far away from where I am.

  Besides the frustrating endless journey, loneliness is another threat. Because I have no experience in this fields, I constantly doubt myself - Am I choose the right way? Am I walking too slowly or too fast? How long will it take to reach the next station? Without an companion, the only effort to comfort myself is to ignore them.

  The excitement and thrilling hope soon subsided. Fear and doubt began to accumulate and finally dominated myself. I was worn out. There comes the time when I found myself ulterly useless. I was 24 and I cannot even feed myself. I tried to carve out in a new field but didn't know whether I am on the right track. Not to mention the endless road I am walking on.
  Is it time to give up?

  I had no answer to that question. All I know is that I have chosen a novel fields to explore and if I gave up and started to explore I had to experience the same frustration. If this **pattern** couldn't be overcome, I will go nowhere further than where I am. I had to sustain myself and keep on walking.

  To deal with the fear and doubt, I developed the [Qotto](quote.yangchenyun.com) to provide inspiration for me. I set it as my default browser page and feed motivation throughout the day.

  Whenever I feel overwhelmed by self-doubt, I force myself to do something - begin reading one or two pages, write several lines of code or write down the fear and doubt.![My yelling self](/images/yelling.jpg) The actions I took always provide me some positive feedback, this feedback makes me feel better.

##Lesson 2: Don't avoid the boring work

  After working on the some personal projects and later in a start-up company, I learned getting the boring things done is necessary to deliver great work.

  Every task has their 20% exciting and 80% boring part but it is **usually the 80% boring part determines the quality of the work**. It applies to every type of work.

  When I was writing [the article](http://ge.tt/3XTYjJg?c), there are dull process such as seeking for the right words to express my idea or correct mistakes in spelling, grammar or word usage. The same applies to design. Andy and Dai (two co-workers at ele.me) used more than 60 days to just adjust the color, icons, button shapes, border lines and other details on the iOS app they are developing. Coding is no exception. When start from scratch, it's not about writing the elegant solution right away, it's ususlly about writing a piece of code, testing, editing former code, testing and moving on. After the first workable solution, you will refactor the code every day.

  Those boring parts are necessary because they are in the process which guarantees the quality of output. Without word refinement and spell checking, I couldn't deliver it out; without improvement on details, current ele.me iOS app won't be stunning elegant; without continuous refactoring there won't be beautiful code.

  It is the boring parts which separates professionals and amateurs.

##Lesson 3: Guard Against Distraction
  Along the year, I recorded 130 new ideas (big or small) and took actions on 43 ones. Some are improvement on what I had been doing and some are sporadic interest in one field. The list covers:
    * Learning Drovak Keyboard
    * Attend 54 Frequent miles program
    * Recite <the old man and sea>
    * Dig into Wordpress
    * Learning Django
    * Worked on several side projects

  All of these projects doesn't sustain longer than one month. Thus the time spent is wasted. This is the **cost of distraction**. What if I turned down all of them but focus my time on one project? At least I would have another output which might be useful.

  It takes time to pull even single one idea off, so I need to guard myself against distraction. I will learn to detect distractions and then prevent yourself from taking actions on them.

  To detect distractions, the **minimal viable rules** help a lot. I will check the idea againt the question 'is it necessary to accomplish my goal?'. If the answer is not an absolutely 'yes', it is an distraction.

  To prevent taking action, I will ask another question against it - 'will you do it one month later? six month later? one year later?' It the answer is no, I won't start it because I cannot sustain myself until I finished it.
