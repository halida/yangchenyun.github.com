##Lesson 1: Know How to Sustain Yourself

  After the first thrilling week after I dived into computer science, things tend out to be much more difficult than I thought before. It's as if without preparation I walked into a Arabic village with a map full of mystical symbols which seems to contain the biggest secret of the city. I started with the simpliest ones, tried to understand it through searching and asking.

  After I have acquired the basic knowledge, I soon realized that there are more areas I need to explore, the map I had is just the entrance of a much bigger world. From times to times, I received news about this bigger world. The more news I heart about it, the eager I wanted to see it, the more frustrating I became - because it is far away from where I am.

  Besides the frustrating endless journey, loneliness is another threat. Because I have no experience in this fields, I constantly doubt myself - Am I choose the right way? Am I walking too slowly or too fast? How long will it take to reach the next station? Without an companion, the only effort to comfort myself is to ignore them.

  The excitement and thrilling hope soon subsided. Fear and doubt began to accumulate and finally dominated myself. I was worn out. There comes the time when I found myself ulterly useless. I was 24 and I cannot even feed myself. I tried to carve out in a new field but didn't know whether I am on the right track. Not to mention the endless road I am walking on.
  Is it time to give up?

  I had no answer to that question. All I know is that I have chosen a novel fields to explore and if I gave up and started to explore I had to experience the same frustration. If this **pattern** couldn't be overcome, I will go nowhere further than where I am. I had to sustain myself and keep on walking.

  To deal with the fear and doubt, I developed the [Qotto](quote.yangchenyun.com) to provide inspiration for me. I set it as my default browser page and feed motivation throughout the day.

  Whenever I feel overwhelmed by self-doubt, I force myself to do something - begin reading one or two pages, write several lines of code or write down the fear and doubt.![My yelling self](/images/yelling.jpg) The actions I took always provide me some positive feedback, this feedback makes me feel better.
