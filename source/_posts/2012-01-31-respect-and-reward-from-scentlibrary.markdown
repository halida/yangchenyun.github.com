I was a little annoyed when Cozi turned me down about my request for Herman Miller Chair and talked about my salary request.

I thought I am asking for my reasonable portion - I worked in a role of CTO - setting up servers, writing backend database and tackling frontend design. I need to overwork several hours a day. I will also diffuse my energy across multiple fields and problems and have less time to focus in one area.

The salary - 1.2w / month I asked is only for a good frontend developer. But they still thought it is too high to make it.

I feel discouraged. I only decided to stay in this company for a while, so get fair payment is among first priority. I don't want to invest my time and energy in this company now.

On the other side, is it an indication that I am not recognized by the community - will a people from Google or Douban be able to request more ?

Am I too self-centered? Should I focus on my work at first - if I am disturbed by these financial concerns, I would lost the power of focus. Try to set yourself free?
