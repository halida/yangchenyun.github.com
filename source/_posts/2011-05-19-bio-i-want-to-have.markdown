In a letter to Yvette:

I have been thinking about the bio for months. The mind has been like a disco ball glittering a profusion of ideas which are always changing and developing. Some are still evolving and for this reason I don't want to disturb the fermentation and might as well wait for them to be ready to be recognized. Some are beginning taking shape and embedding themselves into my plans and, as they are more personal than others, I know they are liable to be accomplished.The words on my epitaph
start:

 "He is a world traveler. He has been to every countries in this world, every provinces in China and every provinces in the United States. He has rode motorcycle across the Americas and trained through the Eurasia. He takes photos, writes texts and draws doodles. He speaks fluently Chinese, English, Spanish and Arabic."

 "He is a father of two kids - a son and a daughter. He lives in a whitish bungalow with a French window facing the sea reflecting the azure sky. He gets up early. He climbed the nearby mound every morning to embrace the sunrise above the tropical horizons."

 "He runs, swims, climbs, dives, dances, sings, hunts, fishes, shoots, fights"

 "He is buried with his wife"

 "He loves."
