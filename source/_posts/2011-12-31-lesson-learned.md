  The experience I had in 2011 is invaluable. It extends my perception of work and achievement. Some lessons are learned through trial-and-error to improve productivity and some are learned from costly mistakes.

##Lesson 1: Know How to Sustain Yourself

###A Frustrating Start

  >Nobody, as long as he moves about among the chaotic currents of life, is without trouble. - Carl Jung

  After the first thrilling weeks I dived into computer science, things turned out to be much more difficult than I thought before. Without preparation I walked into an obscure reign with a 'map' full of mystical symbols. Soon I realized that there were more areas I need to explore, the 'map' I had was just an entrance to a much bigger world. From this world, I would encounter stunning web products on a daily basis. The more products I saw, the eager I wanted to be part of it and the more frustration I ended up with - I didn't even know how to code down a website.

  Besides frustration, self-doubt is another setback. I constantly doubted myself because I had zilch experience in computer science. Am I choose the right technology to learn? Am I learning too slowly? Do I miss something important? How long will it take to reach the next stage? There was no place to find authorized answers. To comfort myself I had to ignore all of them.

  ![My yelling self](/images/yelling.jpg){:class="right"}
  Ignoring didn't solve the problem. As the excitement and confidence subsided, accumulating fear and doubt finally dominated. I was worn out. There comes the time when I found myself utterly useless:

  A 24-year-old who just start learning web design and development without the ability to feed his own living.

  What a bum.

###Always Choose to Take Action

  Time to give up?

  I had no answer to that question. All I know was that if I gave up and started in another field I had to experience the same frustration. If this **pattern of problem** couldn't be overcome, I could go nowhere further than where I was. I had to sustain myself and keep on walking.

  >If this **pattern of problem** couldn't be overcome, I could go nowhere further than where I was.

  I need to **protect my motivation** in order to deal with the fear and doubt. Thus I developed [Qotto][link_to_qotto]{:target="_blank"} - a collection of quotes I like. I set it as my default browser tab and feed me inspiration when I feel disheartened.

  I also decided **always choose to take action** when I feel frustrated. Whenever I feel overwhelmed by self-doubt, I force myself to do something - anything from reading one or two pages of a book to making several lines of code work. The actions I took always provide me positive feedback. I learned one or two tips to use a language, make a small piece of code work under my will. However small they were, it convinced me that I was moving forward. And moving forward is the one important to overcome the frustration.

##Lesson 2: Don't avoid the boring work

  After working on the some personal projects and later in a start-up company, I learned getting the boring things done is necessary to deliver great work.

  Every task has their 20% exciting and 80% boring part but it is **usually the 80% boring part determines the quality of the work**. It applies to every type of work.

  When I was writing [the article][link_to_adult_learning]{:target="_blank"}, there are dull process such as seeking for the right words to express my idea or correct mistakes in spelling, grammar or word usage. The same applies to design. Andy and Dai (two co-workers at ele.me) used more than 60 days to just adjust the color, icons, button shapes, border lines and other details on the iOS app they are developing. Coding is no exception. When start from scratch, it's not about writing the elegant solution right away, it's ususlly about writing a piece of code, testing, editing former code, testing and moving on. After the first workable solution, you will refactor the code every day.

  Those boring parts are necessary because they are in the process which guarantees the quality of output. Without word refinement and spell checking, I couldn't deliver it out; without improvement on details, current ele.me iOS app won't be stunning elegant; without continuous refactoring there won't be beautiful code.

  It is the boring parts which separates professionals and amateurs.

##Lesson 3: Guard Against Distraction
  Along the year, I recorded 130 new ideas (big or small) and took actions on 43 ones. Some are improvement on what I had been doing and some are sporadic interest in one field. The list covers:

  * Learning Drovak Keyboard
  * Attend 54 Frequent miles program
  * Recite <the old man and sea>
  * Dig into Wordpress
  * Learning Django
  * Worked on several side projects

  All of these projects doesn't sustain longer than one month. Thus the time spent is wasted. This is the **cost of distraction**. What if I turned down all of them but focus my time on one project? At least I would have another output which might be useful.

  It takes time to pull even single one idea off, so I need to guard myself against distraction. I will learn to detect distractions and then prevent yourself from taking actions on them.

  To detect distractions, the **minimal viable rules** help a lot. I will check the idea againt the question 'is it necessary to accomplish my goal?'. If the answer is not an absolutely 'yes', it is an distraction.

  To prevent taking action, I will ask another question against it - 'will you do it one month later? six month later? one year later?' It the answer is no, I won't start it because I cannot sustain myself until I finished it.


##Lesson 4: Walk at Your Own Pace
  In the first few weeks, I always crammed too much stuff into one single week - I wanted to read several chapters of a book, write a post, practice programming and design kills. A goal which covers all these was, obvious, unreachable.

  After several rushing but frustrating weeks, I gradually discovered my own pace for **each** task. When reading, I need 8 pages/hour to follow a technology book, 12 pages/hour for topics with familarity, 2-3 pages/hour to follow a literature book. When writing, I need 8 hours to produce an article through the process of organizing, writing and polishing up. When doing design work, I need 15-20 hours to find the right tone of the whole project and I need 4-5 hours for individual page/poster design.

  Whenever I rush a task I will inevitably miss something. If I rush at technology learning, I won't have time to exercise. Thus I will end up with only acquaintance with the technology but not practical knowledge. If I rush a literature book, I will miss the subtle nuance of meaning and end up with a fuzzy story outline. If rush my coding, I will copy and paste snippets from others without fully understanding. Thus my skills aren't improved and maintainance work will be painful in the future.

  Being slow is in fact being fast. It is natural to begin slowly because there are skills to learn, knowledge to acquire and obstacles to overcome. Being a beginner in a novel field, I couldn't predict the situation with accurancy. I need to learn crawling before I could walk and run. Only after practices at a slow pace, I could get myself accustomed to crawling and it is the time I could get my hands off the ground and start learning walking and then running. Being slow is the necessary process before being fast. Rushing up in the beginning will only trip me up.

##Lesson 5: Identify YOUR "Opportunity"
  >When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals, adjust the action steps. - Confucius

  In my second half year, most of my goals are not archieved (English learning, design, backend technology and financial goals), productivity drops and unhappiness arrives. My original direction is diverted to another route. This setback is caused by the fault to mistake "one possible way" for my opportunity.

  Opportunity is a very personal thing. Another people's opportunity isn't necessarily mine as we might have very difference goals. **Opportunity is like the highway which leads to my destination**. There are lots of entrances to different highways. Driving into the wrong ones won't get me closer to my destination.

  To identify the right one, it is essential to have one specific destination. The mistake I made in August is that I was not determined enough to stick to my destination. I was convinced that "being a core team member of a successful project will be a huge booth for my personal goals" and entered this branch 'highway'. It turned out to be so wrong, working with people whose values aren't congruent with mine is a miserable experience.

  This is a costy lesson learned. In 2012, I will lay down the most important goals in the annual plan and use them to prevent the same mistake happenning again.
