A Change Made in 2011

Hey *|FNAME|*,
         There has been a while since we met last time, how is everything going?

         In 2011, I strayed away from my Economics background and taught myself to be a web designer and developer. I was sort of frightened when starting off. One year later, when looking back, I found I have progressed much further than I expected and gained much more courage to pursuit what I want.

         After learning the fundamentals at home for five/six month, I created the site for TEDxFiveStarSquare and helped the design of this event. Later I got involved in the best start-up company in online dining business and led the UI design and frontend development there.

         You could find how I go through this change through the extended review of 2011 and the lessons I learned along the way.

Going through this process without giving up provides me an invaluable experience and confidence to move further. Read More &raquo;

TEDxFiveStarSquare

From a technology gathering, I met Peter and later the whole TEDxFiveStarSquare team in coincidence. I created the site and designed the banner, poster and screen for this event. This is my first 'real world' project and thanks to the great work of all the teammates, we pull this event off. This experience consolidates my confidence to work in the field of design and development. Read More &raquo;

Work at ELEME

In June, I started the NAPOS project with the CTO at ELEME. It is the first interactive software I made. After I finished this work, I joined in the team and contributed to the redesign of ELEME 2011 website and refactoring project. Read More &raquo;

A Talk about Changes

On August 21th, 301 days when I started to take this change, I made a presentation at TEDxYouth West Lake. Based on my experience, I talked about the necessity to bear loneliness, taking actions as a strategy and the importance of endurance. Watch online &raquo;
