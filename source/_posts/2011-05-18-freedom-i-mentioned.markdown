In a letter to Yvette:

Freedom - the most abused word...even become synonymous with "isolation" in your text..

By freedom I mean the situation devoid of chaos in mind and the ability to extend oneself indefinitely.

Once, I would sit in front of the Jokhang Temple everyday before the sunset, watching the pilgrims in patched rags, kneeing down before the threshold doing their prayers. Their palms were put together, touched their forehead, mouth and chest in a row. They crouched down, opened up the arms, finished their communion with Buddha by stretching the body prostrate on the ground. They would repeat this prayer hundreds of time everyday but each was as freshening as the first one they had did before
the sun light stool through the ground of this city. There was no one iota of dreariness among their movement, their repeats were always in the same tempo, rhythm and pose.

There is freedom within their movement, no attachment to narcissism, no disturbance of chaos. I detect the same serenity as you lying on Namtso or waiting for sunlit snowy peak.
